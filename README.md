# A set of useful git hooks

These hooks automate some tasks with the help of git.

## Installation

    git clone git@github.com:greg0ire/git_template.git ~/.git_template

## Configuration

Set the newly cloned repo as your git template directory. This will tell git to
populate new repositories created with either `git clone` or `git init` with
the content of this directory. By default, it uses `/usr/share/git-core/templates`.

    git config --global init.templatedir '~/.git_template'

## What's inside ?

For the moment, mostly hooks related to tools from the php ecosystem.

### Exuberant Ctags hooks

Updates `.git/tags` file by scanning the project with the ctags command. It is
configured for a php project. To make vim look for this file in the `.git`
directory, you can install Tim Pope's [fugitive][4] or simply add
`set tags+=.git/tags` to your .vimrc - some plugins (like [ctrlp-tjump][5])
require this to see the tags even if fugitive is installed.

Enable it :

```sh
git config --add hooks.enabled-plugins php/ctags
```

Also you can specify which kinds of tags ctags should create:

```sh
git config hooks.php-ctags.tag-kinds cdfiv
```

Default value is `cfi`. Execute `ctags --list-kinds` if you want to see which
tag kinds are available.

Optionally, you can set the projectType configuration, like this

```sh
git config hooks.php-ctags.project-type projectType
```

Supported project types :

- symfony1
- symfony2

This will make ctags ignore cache directories.

If you want improved PHP languages support, install the [patched version of ctags][6]
support.

Occurs on `post-checkout`, `post-commit`, and `post-merge`.


### Composer hooks

This set of scripts monitors `composer.lock` changes and updates your vendor
dependencies on `post-checkout` and `post-merge`. Additionally, it checks composer.json for
validity on `pre-commit`. It assumes Composer is [globally installed][1].

You must tell it whether you wish it to run Composer, or if you would rather
it to notify you when you need to do it:

```sh
# If you want Composer to run each time composer.lock changes
git config hooks.composer.onChange run

# If you prefer to get a notification
git config hooks.composer.onChange just_warn
```

If the latter case, you must configure a notifier. Available notifiers for the
moment are `echo` and `notify-send`. So to use `notify-send`, which is pretty
cool, you need to do this (here, globally) :

```sh
git config --global hooks.notification.notifier notify-send
```

Enable it :

```sh
git config --add hooks.enabled-plugins php/composer
```

### Sismo hook

The `post-commit` hook makes [Sismo][2] run each time you commit. It is a post-commit
hook because Sismo is a *local* Continuous Testing Server, which means you can
build before you push.

You must configure the path to the sismo executable, and you may do so globally,
like this:

```sh
git config --global --add hooks.php-sismo.path /usr/share/nginx/html/sismo.php
```

You must also configure the slug of your project:

```sh
git config hooks.php-sismo.slug my-slug
```

Enable it :

```sh
git config --add hooks.enabled-plugins php/sismo
```

### Doctrine hooks

These hooks runs the `doctrine:schema:validate` task of a Symfony project and
updates / migrates your database depending on the presence of a
`doctrine-migrations` folder in your vendor directory on `post-checkout` and
`post-commit`.

Enable it :

```sh
git config --add hooks.enabled-plugins php/doctrine
```

### Junk checker hook

Checks for user defined phrases that you don't want to commit to your
repository, such as `var_dump()`, `console.log()` etc. on `pre-commit`.

This can be overridden by doing a:

```sh
git commit --no-verify
```

This hook is language-agnostic.

You must configure the `phrasesfile` option for this hook . The value is the
name of a file that contains one phrase per line. There is a sample, you can
use it like this :

    git config [--global] hooks.junkchecker.phrasesfile .git/hooks/junkchecker/junk-phrases.sample

Enable it :

```sh
git config --add hooks.enabled-plugins junkchecker
```

### Work In Progress checker hook

Checks for commit messages starting with "WIP" and prevents you from pushing
the corresponding commits. Occurs on `pre-push` (obviously).

This can be ignored with an option :

```sh
git push --no-verify
```

This hook is language-agnostic.

Enable it :

```sh
git config --add hooks.enabled-plugins wipchecker
```

## Usage

### For dummies

Just run the configuration script. From your repository root, run

    .git/configure.sh

The script will help you configure some scripts that shouldn't be configured globally.

### Manual configuration

By default, no hook will run. You must configure the hooks you need:

```sh
git config hooks.enabled-plugins php/composer
git config --add hooks.enabled-plugins php/ctags
git config --add hooks.enabled-plugins junkchecker
```

The `--add` flag is necessary if you don't want to wipe out previously added
plugins.

If you want to enable a plugin on every project, use the `--global` option:

```sh
git config --global --add hooks.enabled-plugins some_plugin
```

## Updating

To get updates you need to update your template directory first :

```sh
# Go to your template directory (probably ~/.git_template)
cd $(git config --path --get init.templatedir)
git pull
```

Then, you can update any repository by running this in the working tree of your
repository :

```sh
$(git config --path --get init.templatedir)/update.sh
# If your template directory is ~/.git_template, this is equivalent to :
~/.git_template/update.sh
```

Make sure you have rsync installed.
